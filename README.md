# Inferential Statistics Report
This is a group assignment for "Math & Statistics for Data Analysis" class where we covered the results of a survey sent out to IE Master students about pizza and hamburger preferences and the following statistical analysis of those results. The objective of this report is to show how statistical analysis helps us achieve pertinent conclusions even in simple surveys like the one done here.
